			<li> Soak the porcini mushrooms in hot water for 20 minutes. Drain, chop and set aside. </li>
			<li> Mix the beaten egg and two thirds of the Parmesan cheese in a large bowlto make the Carbonara sauce. Season with salt and pepper. </li>
			<li> Cook the spaghetti according to the packet instructions. </li>
			<li> Meanwhile, heat the oil in a frying pan and fry the bacon for 3 minutes. Add the fresh mushrooms, porcini mushrooms and garlic and cook for a further 3-4 minutes, stirring frequently </li>
			<li> Drain the spaghetti, reserving 1tbsp of the cooking water. Immediately add the pasta to the Carbonara sauce as well as the reserved cooking water, bacon and mushrooms.
