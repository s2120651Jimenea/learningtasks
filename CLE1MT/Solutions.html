			<h2> Solutions </h2>
	<p>Street children face a variety of issues, including protection, housing, restricted access to food, and limited access to school. We may not be able to assist them address all of their difficulties, but we may be able to solve some of them.</p>
	<h3>Public awareness</h3>
	<p>The majority of people are unaware of the existence of street children. We can tell as many people as possible about the challenges that street children face and what we can do to aid them if we raise awareness. Public awareness raising might be extremely beneficial in this aspect. By telling the tales of various types of street children, we can educate the public. By informing others who are unaware of the issues confronting street children and what can be done to assist them about the problems they encounter. To accomplish this, we must go door to door to ensure that they are willing to assist.</p>
	<h3>The number of development centers should be increased</h3>
	<p>The best organizations and services for street children are development places. Development centers assist street children on a broad scale since they are more knowledgeable about their problems and have better answers. These development centers offer and supply all of the amenities that ordinary children have at home to street children. The children are never given the impression that they are in a center rather than at home. The purpose of the development centers in how to help street children is to prepare them to participate in all of life's healthy activities.</p>
	<h3>The importance of education</h3>
	<p>Education's role in how to aid street children is to produce big personalities for the country and the world. To reduce the number of these youngsters, schools might transport them to schools. However, schools can also prepare youngsters so that they do not engage in undesirable behaviors like as drug addiction, which is especially important for street children. Schools can teach and assist children in becoming engineers, doctors, or pilots in the same way that they can teach and assist other children. They can reduce the number of schoolchildren in this way if they recognize how to tackle the problem of street children as well as the children's desire to leave their homes and go to the streets.</p>
	<h3>Volunteers work for the street children</h3>
	<p>The public welfare free workers are always available to help street children because they are eager to learn about their difficulties and the solutions to their problems. They work for the public at no cost, therefore enlisting their help to reduce the number of street children is highly recommended. The rise in volunteer numbers could be highly beneficial in reducing the number of street children. To understand how to solve the problem of street children, we must first understand the situation they face.</p>
	<h3>Responses by governments</h3>
	<p>Without a doubt, certain governments have organized initiatives to address the issue of street children, with the usual solution of placing street children in juvenile homes, orphanages, or correctional institutions. A number of governments have also struggled to assist or support semi-government services and organizations.</p>
	<p>Instead of relying on organizations and institutions that care for street children, the general public may aid street children and assist the government in identifying solutions to the problem. The rehabilitation clinics also play a vital part in the healing of street children and preparing them to return to their homes because the streets are not their homes.</p>
