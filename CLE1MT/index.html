			<h2> Street Children in the Philippines </h2>
		<p>We refer to youngsters who are referred to as "street children" or "street-connected children" when they live and/or labor on the streets, either alone or with other youngsters or family members.</p>
		<p>Have a strong connection to public areas (such as streets, markets, parks, bus or railway stations), and for whom the street is an important part of their daily lives and identities. Children who do not live or work on the street but frequently follow other children or family members on the streets are included in this larger category.</p>
		<p>In other words, 'street children' are youngsters who rely on the streets for survival, whether they live, work, or have support networks on the streets, or a mix of the three.</p>
		<p>Almost 2 million of Manila's 2.5 million children under the age of 15 live in poverty or near it. 75,000 of these youngsters are homeless after fleeing their homes or being abandoned. They scavenge for food, beg, steal, and sell newspapers, cigarettes, and leis.</p>
