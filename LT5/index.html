		<h1>Birth Month Flowers</h1>
		
		<p>Flowers were used as a form of communication long before email, texting, instant messaging, or even phone calls. Florography, or the language of flowers, was popular in the 18th and 19th centuries. Despite the fact that we now have more ways to communicate, messages conveyed through flowers are as meaningful today as they were in the past. Each birth month flower has its own meaning and will make the recipient feel extra special.</p>

			<h3>January: Carnation and Snowdrop</h3>
		<p><img src="carnation.png"></p>
		<p>The January birth flowers are carnations and snowdrops. Which isn’t surprising considering they’re two of the very few flowers that thrive in winter! Carnations are very popular among many, with their big, ruffled petals and variety of colours, but they’re especially perfect as gifts for January babies.</p>
		<p>Carnations have a rich history behind them too. Dating back to thousands of years, carnations held a special place in the hearts of Christians. As it was believed that the very first carnations bloomed from Mary’s tears as she wept for Jesus. While the meaning of carnations can change depending on the colour, generally they symbolise devotion, loyalty and love.</p>
		<p>Based on your birth flowers, if you were born in January we imagine that you're someone who loves deeply and passionately. You’re probably an extremely loyal, protective friend to have around too and believe that family is everything.</p>

		<h3>February: Violet and Iris</h3>
		<p><img src="iris.png"></p>
		<p>The February birth flowers are violet and iris. Because February is always associated with Valentine’s Day it always surprises people when they find out that roses aren’t actually the official birth flower of the month. But, when you consider the February birthstone is amethyst, you can see why violets are the birth month flower. Those February babies just seem to love purple tones!</p>
		<p>The vivid violets have actually been around for centuries! And were cultivated by Ancient Greeks who used them for medicinal purposes and to make wine taste that little bit extra sweet. But, one of our favourite facts about violets are that because of their instantly-recognisable heart-shaped petals, they were used in love potions!</p>
		<p>Nowadays, violets symbolise faithfulness, humility and spiritual wisdom. And irises symbolise eloquence, faith, wisdom and hope. So those born in February are said to be honest, humble, wise and innocent, making them pretty good people to be around.</p>
